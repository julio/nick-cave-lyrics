other day [...] The wind hung wet around my neck [...] My head it rung with screams and groans [...] From the night I spent amongst her bones [...] I past beside the mission house [...] Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend, [...] Shrieked and flapped about life after you're dead [...] Well, I thought about my friend, Michel [...] How they rolled him in linoleum [...] And shot him in the neck [...] A bloody halo, like a think-bubble [...] Circling his head [...] And I bellowed at the firmament [...] Looks like the rains are here to stay [...] And the rain pissed down upon me [...] And washed me all away [...] Saying", "Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Well, the road is long [...] And the road is hard [...] And many fall by the side [...] But Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] So there ain't no need to cry", "And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road [...] And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road", "Well, the moon it looked exhausted [...] Like something you should pity [...] Spent an age-spotted [...] Above the sizzling wires of the city [...] Well, it reminded me of her face [...] Her bleached and hungry eyes [...] Her hair was like a curtain [...] Falling open with the laughter [...] And closing with the lies [...] But the ghost of her still lingers on [...] Though she's passed through me [...] And is gone [...] The slum dogs, they are barking [...] And the rain children on the streets [...] And the tears that we will weep today [...] Will all be washed away [...] By the tears that we will weep again tomorrow", "Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] For the road is long [...] And the road is hard [...] And many fall by the side [...] But Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] So there ain't no need to cry", "And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road [...] And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road", "And I came upon a little house [...] A little house upon a hill [...] And I entered through, the curtain hissed [...] Into the house with its blood-red bowels [...] Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists [...] Crawled the ceilings and the walls [...] They filled me full of drink [...] And led me round the rooms [...] Naked and cold and grinning [...] Until everything went black [...] And I came down spinning [...] I awoke so drunk and full of rage [...] That I could hardly speak [...] A fag in a whale-bone corset [...] Draping his dick across my cheek [...] And its into the shame [...] And its into the guilt [...] And its into the fucking fray [...] And the walls ran red around me [...] A warm arterial spray [...] Saying", "Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Well, the night is dark [...] And the night is deep [...] And its jaws are open wide [...] But Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] So there ain't no need to cry", "And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road [...] And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road", "It's the rainy season where I'm living [...] Death comes leaping out of every doorway [...] Wasting you for your money, for your clothes [...] And for your nothing [...] Entire towns being washed away [...] Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways [...] Lynch-mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains [...] The mad heat and the relentless rains [...] And if you stick your arm into that hole [...] It comes out sheared off to the bone [...] And with her kisses bubbling on my lips [...] I swiped the rain and nearly missed [...] And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road [...] Singing", "Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] Papa won't leave you, Boy [...] Well, the road is long [...] And the road is hard [...] And many fall by the side [...] But Papa won't leave you, Henry [...] So there ain't no need to cry", "And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road [...] And I went on down the road [...] He went on down the road", "Bent beneath my heavy load [...] Under his heavy load [...] Yeah, I went on down the road [...] Yeah, he went on down the road", "Woah, woah [...] Woah, woah [...] Woah, woah [...] Woah, woah [...] And I went on down that road"]}, {"id": "2", "title": "I Had A Dream, Joe", "lyrics": ["I

[...] I had a dream, Joe [...] It was Autumn time and thick fell the leaves [...] And in that dream, Joe [...] A pimp in a seersucker suit sucked a toothpick [...] And pointed his finger at me", "I had a dream [...] I had a dream [...] I had a dream, Joe", "I opened my eyes, Joe [...] The night had been a giant, dribbling and pacing the boards [...] I opened my eyes, Joe [...] All your letters and cards stacked up against the door [...] I opened my eyes, Joe [...] The morning light came slowly tumbling through the crack [...] In the window, Joe [...] And I thought of you and I felt like I was lugging [...] A body on my back", "I had a dream [...] I had a dream [...] I had a dream, Joe", "Where did you go, Joe? [...] On that endless, senseless, demented drift [...] Where did you go, Joe? [...] Into the woods, into the trees, where did you move and shift [...] Where did you go, Joe? [...] All dressed up in your ridiculous seersucker suit [...] Where did you go, Joe? [...] With that strew of wreckage [...] Forever at the heal of your boot", "I had a dream [...] I had a dream [...] I had a dream, Joe [...] I had a dream [...] I had a dream [...] I had a dream, Joe"]}, {"id": "3", "title": "Straight To You", "lyrics": ["All the towers of ivory are crumbling [...] And the swallows have sharpened their beaks [...] This is the time of our great undoing [...] This is the time that I'll come running [...] Straight to you [...] For I am captured [...] Straight to you [...] For I am captured [...] One more time", "The light in our window is fading [...] The candle gutters on the ledge [...] Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing [...] And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running [...] Straight to you [...] For I am captured [...] Once again", "Gone are the days of rainbows [...] Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars [...] For the sea will swallow up the mountains [...] And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks [...] Straight at you [...] But I'll come a-running [...] Straight to you [...] But I'll come a-running [...] One more time", "Heaven has denied us its kingdom [...] The saints are drunk and howling at the moon [...] The chariots of angels are colliding [...] Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running [...] Straight to you [...] For I am captured [...] Straight to you [...] For I am captured [...] One more time"]}, {"id": "4", "title": "Brother, My Cup Is Empty", "lyrics": ["Brother, my cup is empty [...] And I haven't got a penny [...] For to buy no more whiskey [...] I have to go home", "I am the captain of my pain [...] Tis the bit, the bridle, [...] The thrashing cane [...] The stirrup, the harness, [...] The whipping mane [...] The pickled eye [...] The shrinking brain [...] O brother, buy me one more drink [...] I'll explain the nature of my pain [...] Yes, let me tell you once again [...] I am the captain of my pain", "O brother, my cup is empty [...] And I haven't got a penny [...] For to buy no more whiskey [...] I have to go home", "I cannot blame it all on her [...] To blame her all would be a lie [...] For many a night I lay awake [...] And wished that I could watch her die [...] To see her accusing finger spurt [...] To see flies swarm her hateful eye [...] To watch her groaning in the dirt [...] To see her clicking tongue crack dry [...] O brother, buy me one more drink [...] One more drink and then goodbye [...] And do not mock me when I say [...] Let's drink one more before I die", "O brother, my cup is empty [...] And I haven't got a penny [...] For to buy no more whiskey [...] I have to go home", "Well I've been sliding down on rainbows [...] I've been swinging from the stars [...] Now this wretch in beggar's clothing [...] Bangs his cup across the bars [...] Look, this cup of mine is empty!

of human corruption [...] Into an oven she did crawl", "O Christina the Astonishing [...] Behaved in a terrifying way [...] She would run wildly through the streets [...] Jump in the Meusse and swim

all giving me stares [...] Armed, as they were, with machetes [...] And the night through the window was full of lights [...] Winking and a-watching at John Finn's wife [...] Winking and a-watching at John Finn's wife", "Next came the cops, all out on the town [...] But it don't look like no trouble there [...] As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits [...] And I slip my hand between the thighs of John Finn's wife [...] And they seemed to yawn awake, her thighs [...] It was a warm and very ferocious night [...] The moon was full of blood and light [...] And my eyes grew small and my

twine [...] Cause all i got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife [...] And mad John Finn's wife is all [...] And the three of us walk out of the hall", "Now the night bore down upon us all [...] You
