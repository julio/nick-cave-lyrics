                "Once there was a song [...] The song yearned to be sung [...] It was a spinning song [...] About the king of rock 'n' roll",

                "The king had a queen [...] The queen's hair was a stairway [...] She tended the castle garden [...] And in the garden planted a tree",
                "The garden tree was a stairway [...] It was sixteen branches high [...] On the top branch was a nest [...] Sing the high cloudy nest",
                "In the nest there was a bird [...] The bird had a wing [...] The wing had a feather [...] Spin the feather and sing the wind",
                "The king in time died [...] The queen's heart broke like a vow [...] And the tree returned to the earth [...] With the nest and the bird",
                "But the feather spun upward [...] Upward and upward [...] Spinning all the weather vanes [...] And you're sitting at the kitchen table [...] Listening to the radio",
                "And I love you [...] And I love you [...] And I love you [...] And I love you [...] And I love you [...] And I love you [...] And I love you",

                "And everyone has a heart and it's calling for something [...] And we are all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are [...] Horses are just horses and their manes aren't full of fire [...] And the fields are just fields and there ain't no Lord [...] And everyone is hidden and everyone is cruel [...] And there is no shortage of tyrants and no shortage of fools [...] And the little white shape dancing at the end of the hall [...] Is just a wish that time can't dissolve at all",
                "This world is plain to see [...] It don't mean we can't believe [...] In something and any way [...] My baby's coming back now [...] On the next train [...] I can hear the whistle blowing [...] I can hear the mighty roar [...] I can hear the horses prancing [...] In the pastures of the Lord [...] Oh the train is coming [...] And I'm standing here to see [...] And it's bringing my baby [...] Right back to me [...] Well there are some things [...] That are hard to explain [...] But my baby's coming home now [...] On the 5.30 train"

                "A fountain throbs in the lobby of the Grand Hotel [...] The spurting font of creativity, yeah I know [...] Your head in a pool of your own streaming hair [...] And Jesus lying in his mother's arms, just so [...] Up on the wall, just so",
