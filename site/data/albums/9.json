in between [...] Plunge your hands into the water [...] And drown it in the sea [...] There will be nothing between us, baby [...] But the air that we breathe [...] Don't cry [...] It's a wonderful life, wonderful life [...] if you can find it [...] If you can find it [...] If you can find it [...] It's a wonderful life that you bring [...] It's a wonderful, wonderful thing", "We can build our dungeons in the air [...] And sit and cry the blues [...] We can stomp across this world [...] With nails hammered through our shoes [...] We can join that troubled chorus [...] Who criticise and accuse [...] It don't matter much [...] We got nothing much to lose [...] But this wonderful life [...] If you can find it [...] And when you find it [...] And when you find it [...] It's a wonderful life that you bring [...] It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful thing", "Sometimes our secrets are all we've got [...] With our lives we must defend [...] Sometimes the air between us, babe [...] Is unbearably thin [...] Sometimes it's wise to lay down your gloves [...] And just give in [...] Come in, come in [...] Come in, come in [...] To this wonderful life [...] If you can find it [...] And

bedroom door and said I ain't going in there [...] She leaped out of her seat and screamed someone's not concentrating here [...] There's a dead man in my bed, she said [...] I ain't speaking metaphorically [...] His eyes are open but he cannot see [...] There's a dead man in my bed", "Then leaves outside the window waved, all brown, they were, and falling [...] Even I could tell the atmosphere in here was utterly appalling [...] The phone it rand incessantly but nobody was calling [...] There's a dead man in my bed, she said [...] And though he keeps on taking notes [...] I swear this ain't some kind of hoax [...] There's a dead man in my bed", "Now she's in the kitchen rattling those pots and pans [...] I'd cook him something nice, she said, but he refuses to wash his hands [...] He used to be so good to me, but now he smells so fucking bad [...] There is a dead man in my bed, she says [...] I keep poking at him with my stick [...] But his skin is just so fucking thick

don't know if it's day or night [...] Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes [...] You're making coffee for everyone concerned [...] Someone points to this and someone points to that [...] Everyone is saying that you should lie down [...] But you ain't having none of that [...] And I say to the sleepy summer rain [...] With a complete absence of pain [...] You might think I'm crazy [...] But I'm still in love with you", "Hide your eyes, hide your tears [...] Hide your face, my love [...] Hide your ribbons, hide your bows [...] Hide your coloured cotton gloves [...] Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures [...] Hide your neatly scissored locks [...] Hide your memories, hide them all [...] Stuff them in a cardboard box [...] Or throw them into the street below [...] Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow [...] For you might think I'm crazy [...] But I'm still in love with you", "Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call [...] Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all [...] Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs [...] One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair [...] The other one resting on your hip [...] Without a solitary care [...] I fall to sleep in the summer rain [...] With no single memory of pain [...] And you might think I'm crazy [...] But I'm still in love with you"]}, {"id": "7", "title": "There Is a
