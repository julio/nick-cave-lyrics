[...] She was given to me to put things right [...] And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her [...] Still I seemed so obsolete and small [...] I found God and all His devils inside her [...] In my bed she cast the blizzard out [...] A mock sun blazed upon her head [...] So completely filled with light she was [...] Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad [...] Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled [...] And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle", "Do you love me? [...] She had a heartful of love and devotion [...] She had a mindful of tyranny and terror [...] Well, I try, I do, I really try [...] But I just err, baby, I do, I error [...] So come find me, my darling one [...] I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs [...] Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun [...] Blood running down the inside of her legs [...] The moon in the sky is battered and mangled [...] And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle", "Do you love me? [...] All things move toward their end [...] I knew before I met her that I would lose her [...] I swear I made every effort to be good to her [...] I swear I made every effort not to abuse her [...] Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles [...] And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle"]}, {"id": "2", "title": "Nobody's Baby Now", "lyrics": ["I've searched the holy books [...] Tried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviour [...] I've read the poets and the analysts [...] Searched through the books on human behaviour [...] I travelled the whole world around [...] For an answer that refused to be found [...] I don't know why and I don't know how [...] But she's nobody's baby now", "I loved her then and I guess I love her still [...] Hers is the face I see when a certain mood moves in [...] She lives in my blood and skin [...] Her wild feral stare, her dark hair [...] Her winter lips as cold as stone [...] Yeah, I was her man [...] But there are some things even love won't allow [...] I held her hand but I don't hold it now [...] I don't know why and I don't know how [...] But she's nobody's baby now", "This is her dress that I loved best [...] With the blue quilted violets across the breast [...] And these are my many letters [...] Torn to pieces by her long-fingered hand [...] I was her cruel-hearted man [...] And though I've tried to lay her ghost down [...] She's moving through me, even now [...] I don't know why and I don't know how [...] But she's nobody's baby now"]}, {"id": "3", "title": "Loverman", "lyrics": ["There's a devil waiting outside your door [...] (How much longer?)
